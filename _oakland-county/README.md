# Oakland County Precinct-Level Election Maps

Precinct-level election maps for Oakland County, covering the last **6** major elections in Michigan from 2008 to 2018.

## Why are some maps missing precincts?

Because the data did not merge 100% correctly between the shapefiles and the election results. I made corrections to get as many precincts as I could, but there are still a few stragglers, which show up as white on the maps. Sorry.

## Partisanship and Turnout

2010/2014/2018 are midterm years while 2008/2012/2016 are presidential years. Midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout. While some precincts appear to have flipped from preferring one major party to preferring the other (and may have flipped *back*, too!), this can be attributable to a change in turnout as much as to some change in net partisanship among the voters in that precinct (due to swing voters, independents, voters moving into and leaving the precinct, aging into and out of the electorate, etc.). So it is important to look not just at the partisanship maps, but also at the corresponding turnout maps.
