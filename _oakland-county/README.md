# Oakland County Precinct-Level Election Maps

## Partisanship and Turnout

2010/2014/2018 are midterm years while 2008/2012/2016 are presidential years. Midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout.

While some precincts appear to have flipped from preferring one major party to preferring the other (and may have flipped *back*, too!), this can be attributable to a change in turnout as much as to some change in net partisanship. So it is important to look not just at the partisanship maps, but also at the corresponding turnout maps.
