# 1158 Michigan precincts voted for Senator Peters in 2014 & President Trump in 2016

> Make of that what you will. It could be a swing in the electorate such that people who voted for Peters in 2014 became more Republican-leaning from 2014 to 2016. Or, it could be that Trump-Peters voters are genuine swing voters who might vote for both Trump and Peters next year (if this is the case, having Trump on the ballot may not help Peters' Republican challenger, John James, as much as MI Republicans may have hoped).
