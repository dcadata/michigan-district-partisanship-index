# District Info Project

## About

The District Info Bot is a script that supplies on-demand, relevant district information/context to social media users talking about a U.S. congressional district.

Currently, it runs on the social media platform Reddit using their API. It is monitoring the following political subreddits: `VoteBlue`, `Democrats`, `Conservative`, `Republican`. To avoid spamming, the script only replies in the specific mentioned subreddits. However, due to the nature of the submissions in each subreddit, almost all of the script's replies have been in `VoteBlue`.

Given this use case, districts with missing data were dropped and voteshares (percentages) were rounded to the nearest percent or to one decimal place depending on the field.
